 * This file is an example of usage of the tld() function defined in the
 * libtld library. As another example, you can check the following file
 * in the source package:
 *
 * src/validate_tld.cpp
 *
 * Although it is written in C++, it shows the different ways to check
 * a URI and an email address.

/** \brief Simple example of a call to the tld() function.
 *
 * The following is a very simple code sample used to present the libtld
 * library usage.
 *
 * To test different URIs, edit the file and change the uri variable
 * defined below.
 *
 * \include example.c
 *
 * \param[in] argc  Number of command line arguments passed in.
 * \param[in] argv  The arguments passed in.
 *
 * \return The function returns 0 on success, 1 otherwise.
