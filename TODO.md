* Make the coverage 100% since I added a lot of code for v2.x it's not complete.
* Make sure the superstring is checked on both ends, I think I test only one.
* Further enhance the TLD definitions.
* Look at having a way to detect TLDs we have defined and are not in the
  `public_suffix_list.dat`.
* Review the README.md and other docs to make them up to date to v2.x.
* Clean up the copyright notices.
* Verify that it still works with the latest version of PHP.
* Add a Debian package that installs the PHP extension (so auto-build that too).
* Look at adding a Node.js extension.
* Convert everything to C++ and offer an interface to C programmers.
