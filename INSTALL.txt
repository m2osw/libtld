ABOUT libtld
============

The project can be found online at this URI:

    https://snapwebsites.org/project/libtld

That page has some basic documentation and latest information about the
library.


INSTALLING UNDER UBUNTU 16.04+
==============================

Packages are available on launchpad in the
[snapcpp PPA](https://code.launchpad.net/~snapcpp/+archive/ppa/+packages).
You may want to consider using the packages directly instead of attempting
to compile libtld yourself. It should save you a lot of time.

If the packages are not available for your version, check out the
[github source](https://github.com/m2osw/libtld) instead.


REQUIREMENTS
============

The library requirements are:

* Qt 4.8+ -- to compile the `tld_parser.cpp` which generates the `tld_data.c`
file
* boost -- for the C++ code
* doxygen -- currently required with the new cmake scheme
* dot (optional) -- recommanded if you want more complete documentations
* php5-dev -- if you want to create the PHP extension
* cmake -- the tool to generate the Makefile (no auto-tool or configure!)
* make -- to run the Makefile
* gcc & g++ -- to compile everything
* gcov & lcov -- to run coverage tests and generate HTML as output


BUILDING
========

The following are the basic steps once all the necessary requirements were
installed on your system:

    tar xf snapcmakemodules_x.y.z.tar.gz
    tar xf libtld-x.y.z.tar.gz
    mkdir BUILD
    cd BUILD
    cmake -DCMAKE_MODULE_PATH=../snapCMakeModules/Modules ../libtld
    make
    sudo make install

To install the package exactly where you would like it to be, you will
want to make sure that the cmake tool is called with the correct
installation prefix.


COMMAND LINE TEST
=================

You may test a URI from the command line, once you installed everything
(or from your BUILD directory) using the `validate_tld` tool as in:

    # Valid test:
    validate_tld https://snapwebsites.org/project/libtld

    # Invalid test:
    validate_tld https://snapwebsites.organization/project/libtld
