 *
 * \section introduction The libtld Library
 *
 * The libtld project is a library that gives you the capability to
 * determine the TLD part of any Internet URI or email address.
 *
 * The main function of the library, tld(), takes a URI string and a
 * tld_info structure. From that information it computes the position
 * where the TLD starts in the URI. For email addresses (see the
 * tld_email_list C++ object, or the tld_email.cpp file for the C
 * functions,) it breaks down a full list of emails verifying the
 * syntax as defined in RFC 5822.
 *
 * \section c_programmers For C Programmers
 *
 * The C functions that you are expected to use are listed here:
 *
 * \li tld_version() -- return a string representing the TLD library version
 * \li tld() -- find the position of the TLD of any URI
 * \li tld_domain_to_lowercase() -- force lowercase on the domain name before
 *                                  calling other tld function
 * \li tld_check_uri() -- verify a full URI, with scheme, path, etc.
 * \li tld_clear_info() -- reset a tld_info structure for use with tld()
 * \li tld_email_alloc() -- allocate a tld_email_list object
 * \li tld_email_free() -- free a tld_email_list object
 * \li tld_email_parse() -- parse a list of email addresses
 * \li tld_email_count() -- number of emails found by tld_email_parse()
 * \li tld_email_rewind() -- go back at the start of the list of emails
 * \li tld_email_next() -- read the next email from the list of emails
 *
 * \section cpp_programmers For C++ Programmers
 *
 * For C++ users, please make use of these tld classes:
 *
 * \li tld_object
 * \li tld_email_list
 *
 * In C++, you may also make use of the tld_version() to check the current
 * version of the library.
 *
 * To check whether the version is valid for your tool, you may look at the
 * version handling of the libdebpackages library of the wpkg project. The
 * libtld version is always a Debian compatible version.
 *
 * http://windowspackager.org/documentation/implementation-details/debian-version-api
 *
 * \section php_programmers For PHP Programmers
 *
 * At this point I do not have a very good environment to recompile everything
 * for PHP. The main reason is because the library is being compiled with cmake
 * opposed to the automake toolchain that Zend expects.
 *
 * This being said, the php directory includes all you need to make use of the
 * library under PHP. It works like a charm for me and there should be no reason
 * for you not to be able to do the same with the library.
 *
 * The way I rebuild everything for PHP:
 *
 * \code
 * # from within the libtld directory:
 * mkdir ../BUILD
 * (cd ../BUILD; cmake ../libtld)
 * make -C ../BUILD
 * cd php
 * ./build
 * \endcode
 *
 * The build script will copy the resulting php_libtld.so file where it
 * needs to go using sudo. Your system (Red Hat, Mandrake, etc.) may use
 * su instead. Update the script as required.
 *
 * Note that the libtld will be linked statically inside the php_libtld.so
 * so you do not have to actually install the libtld environment to make
 * everything work as expected.
 *
 * The resulting functions added to PHP via this extension are:
 *
 * \li %check_tld()
 * \li %check_uri()
 * \li %check_email()
 *
 * For information about these functions, check out the php/php_libtld.c
 * file which describes each function, its parameters, and its results
 * in great details.
 *
 * \section not_linux Compiling on Other Platforms
 *
 * We can successfully compile the library under MS-Windows with cygwin
 * and the Microsoft IDE. To do so, we use the CMakeLists.txt file found
 * under the dev directory. Overwrite the CMakeLists.txt file in the
 * main directory before configuring and you'll get a library without
 * having to first compile Qt4.
 *
 * \code
 * cp dev/libtld-only-CMakeLists.txt CMakeListst.txt
 * \endcode
 *
 * At this point this configuration only compiles the library. It gives
 * you a shared (.DLL) and a static (.lib) version. With the IDE you may
 * create a debug and a release version.
 *
 * Later we'll look into having a single CMakeLists.txt so you do not
 * have to make this copy.
 *
 * \section example Example
 *
 * We offer a file named example.c that shows you how to use the
 * library in C. It is very simple, one main() function so it is
 * very easy to get started with libtld.
 *
 * For a C++ example, check out the src/validate_tld.cpp tool which was
 * created as a command line tool coming with the libtld library.
 *
 * \include example.c
 *
 * \section dev Programmers & Maintainers
 *
 * If you want to work on the library, there are certainly things to
 * enhance. We could for example offer more offsets in the info
 * string, or functions to clearly define each part of the URI.
 *
 * However, the most important part of this library is the XML file
 * which defines all the TLDs. Maintaining that file is what will
 * help the most. It includes all the TLDs known at this point
 * (as defined in different places such as Wikipedia and each
 * different authority in that area.) The file is easy to read so
 * you can easily find whether your extension is defined and if not
 * you can let us know.
 *
 * \section requirements Library Requirements
 *
 * \li Usage
 *
 * The library doesn't need anything special. It's a few C functions.
 *
 * The library also offers a C++ classes. You do not need a C++ compiler
 * to use the library, but if you do program in C++, you can use the
 * tld_object and tld_email_list instead of the C functions. It makes
 * things a lot easier!
 *
 * Also if you are programming using PHP, the library includes a PHP
 * extension so you can check URIs and emails directly from PHP without
 * trying to create crazy regular expressions (that most often do not work
 * right!)
 *
 * \li Compiling
 *
 * To compile the library, you'll need CMake, a C++ compiler for different
 * parts and the Qt library as we use the QtXml and QtCore (Qt4). The QtXml
 * library is used to parse the XML file (tld_data.xml) which defines all
 * the TLDs, worldwide.
 *
 * To regenerate the documentation we use Doxygen. It is optional, though.
 *
 * \li PHP
 *
 * In order to recompile the PHP extension the Zend environment is required.
 * Under a Debian or Ubuntu system you can install the php5-dev package.
 *
 * \section tests Tests Coming with the Library
 *
 * We have the following tests at this time:
 *
 * \li tld_test.c
 *
 * \par
 * This test checks the tld() function as end users of the
 * library. It checks all the existing TLDs, a few unknown TLDs,
 * and invalid TLDs.
 *
 * \li tld_test_object.cpp
 *
 * \par
 * This test verifies that the tld_object works as expected. It is not
 * exhaustive in regard to the tld library itself, only of the tld_object.
 *
 * \li tld_internal_test.c
 *
 * \par
 * This test includes the tld.c directly so it can check each
 * internal function directly. This test checks the cmp() and
 * search() functions, with full coverage.
 *
 * \li tld_test_domain_lowercase.c
 *
 * \par
 * This test runs 100% coverage of the tld_domain_to_lowercase() function.
 * This includes conversion of %XX encoded characters and UTF-8 to wide
 * characters that can be case folded and saved back as encoded %XX
 * characters. The test verifies that all characters are properly
 * supported and that errors are properly handled.
 *
 * \li tld_test_tld_names.cpp
 *
 * \par
 * The Mozilla foundation offers a file with a complete list of all the
 * domain names defined throughout the world. This test reads that list
 * and checks all the TLDs against the libtld system. Some TLDs may be
 * checked in multiple ways. We support the TLDs that start with an
 * asterisk (*) and those that start with an exclamation mark (!) which
 * means all the TLDs are now being checked out as expected.
 * This test reads the effective_tld_names.dat file which has to be
 * available in your current directory.
 *
 * \par
 * A copy of the Mozilla file is included with each version of the TLD
 * library. It is named tests/effective_tld_names.dat and should be
 * up to date when we produce a new version for download on
 * SourceForge.net.
 *
 * \li tld_test_full_uri.c
 *
 * \par
 * The library includes an advanced function that checks the validity
 * of complete URIs making it very simple to test such in any software.
 * The URI must include a scheme (often called protocol), fully qualified
 * domain (sub-domains, domain, TLD), an absolute path, variables (after
 * the question mark,) and an anchor. The test ensures that all the
 * checks the parser uses are working as expected and allow valid URIs
 * while it forbids any invalid URIs.
 *
 * \li tld_test_emails.cpp
 *
 * \par
 * The libtld supports verifying and breaking up emails in different
 * parts. This is done to make sure users enter valid emails (although
 * it doesn't mean that the email address exists, it at least allows
 * us to know when an email is definitively completely incorrect and
 * should be immediately rejected.) The test ensures that all the
 * different types of invalid emails are properly being caught (i.e.
 * emails with control characters, invalid domain name, missing parts,
 * etc.)
 *
 * \li tld_test_versions.c
 *
 * \par
 * This test checks that the versions in all the files (two
 * CMakeLists.txt and the changelog) are equal. If one of those
 * does not match, then the test fails.
 *
 * \li tld_test_xml.sh
 *
 * \par
 * Shell script to run against the tld_data.xml file to ensure its validity.
 * This is a good idea any time you make changes to the file. It runs with
 * the xmllint tool. If you do not have the tool, it won't work. The tool
 * is part of the libxml2-utils package under Ubuntu.

/** \brief Compare two strings, one of which is limited by length.
 * \internal
 *
 * This internal function was created to handle a simple string
 * (no locale) comparison with one string being limited in length.
 *
 * The comparison does not require locale since all characters are
 * ASCII (a URI with Unicode characters encode them in UTF-8 and
 * changes all those bytes with %XX.)
 *
 * The length applied to the string in \p b. This allows us to make
 * use of the input string all the way down to the cmp() function.
 * In other words, we avoid a copy of the string.
 *
 * The string in \p a is 'nul' (\0) terminated. This means \p a
 * may be longer or shorter than \p b. In other words, the function
 * is capable of returning the correct result with a single call.
 *
 * If parameter \p a is "*", then it always matches \p b.
 *
 * \param[in] a  The pointer in an f_tld field of the tld_descriptions.
 * \param[in] b  Pointer directly in referencing the user domain string.
 * \param[in] n  The number of characters that can be checked in \p b.
 *
 * \return -1 if a < b, 0 when a == b, and 1 when a > b

/** \brief Search for the specified domain.
 * \internal
 *
 * This function executes one search for one domain. The
 * search is binary, which means the tld_descriptions are
 * expected to be 100% in order at all levels.
 *
 * The \p i and \p j parameters represent the boundaries
 * of the current level to be checked. Know that for a
 * given TLD, there is a start and end boundary that is
 * used to define \p i and \p j. So except for the top
 * level, the bounds are limited to one TLD, sub-TLD, etc.
 * (for example, .uk has a sub-layer with .co, .ac, etc.
 * and that ground is limited to the second level entries
 * accepted within the .uk TLD.)
 *
 * This search does one search at one level. If sub-levels
 * are available for that TLD, then it is the responsibility
 * of the caller to call the function again to find out whether
 * one of those sub-domain name is in use.
 *
 * When the TLD cannot be found, the function returns -1.
 *
 * \param[in] i  The start point of the search (included.)
 * \param[in] j  The end point of the search (excluded.)
 * \param[in] domain  The domain name to search.
 * \param[in] n  The length of the domain name.
 *
 * \return The offset of the domain found, or -1 when not found.

/** \brief Get information about the TLD for the specified URI.
 *
 * The tld() function searches for the specified URI in the TLD
 * descriptions. The results are saved in the info parameter for
 * later interpretetation (i.e. extraction of the domain name,
 * sub-domains and the exact TLD.)
 *
 * The function extracts the last \em extension of the URI. For
 * example, in the following:
 *
 * \code
 * example.co.uk
 * \endcode
 *
 * the function first extracts ".uk". With that \em extension, it
 * searches the list of official TLDs. If not found, an error is
 * returned and the info parameter is set to \em unknown.
 *
 * When found, the function checks whether that TLD (".uk" in our
 * previous example) accepts sub-TLDs (second, third, forth and
 * fifth level TLDs.) If so, it extracts the next TLD entry (the
 * ".co" in our previous example) and searches for that second
 * level TLD. If found, it again tries with the third level, etc.
 * until all the possible TLDs were exhausted. At that point, it
 * returns the last TLD it found. In case of ".co.uk", it returns
 * the information of the ".co" TLD, second-level domain name.
 *
 * All the comparisons are done in lowercase. This is because
 * all the data is saved in lowercase and we expect the input
 * of the tld() function to already be in lowercase. If you
 * have a doubt and your input may actually be in uppercase,
 * make sure to call the tld_domain_to_lowercase() function
 * first. That function makes a duplicate of your domain name
 * in lowercase. It understands the %XX characters (since the
 * URI is expected to still be encoded) and properly handles
 * UTF-8 characters in order to define the lowercase characters
 * of the input. Note that the function returns a newly
 * allocated pointer that you are responsible to free once
 * you are done with it.
 *
 * \warning
 * If you call tld() with the pointer return by
 * tld_domain_to_lowercase(), keep in mind that the tld()
 * function saves pointers of the input string directly in
 * the tld_info structure. In other words, you want to free()
 * that string AFTER you are done with the tld_info structure.
 *
 * The \p info structure includes:
 *
 * \li f_category -- the category of TLD, unless set to
 * TLD_CATEGORY_UNDEFINED, it is considered valid
 * \li f_status -- the status of the TLD, unless set to
 * TLD_STATUS_UNDEFINED, it was defined from the tld_data.xml file;
 * however, only those marked as TLD_STATUS_VALID are considered to
 * currently be in use, all the other statuses can be used by your
 * software, one way or another, but it should not be accepted as
 * valid in a URI
 * \li f_country -- if the category is set to TLD_CATEGORY_COUNTRY
 * then this pointer is set to the name of the country
 * \li f_tld -- is set to the full TLD of your domain name; this is
 * a pointer WITHIN your uri string so make sure you keep your URI
 * string valid if you intend to use this f_tld string
 * \li f_offset -- the offset to the first period within the domain
 * name TLD (i.e. in our previous example, it would be the offset to
 * the first period in ".co.uk", so in "example.co.uk" the offset would
 * be 7. Assuming you prepend "www." to have the URI "www.example.co.uk"
 * then the offset would be 11.)
 *
 * \note
 * In our previous example, the ".uk" TLD is properly used: it includes
 * a second level domain name (".co".) The URI "example.uk" should have
 * returned TLD_RESULT_INVALID since .uk by itself was not supposed to be
 * acceptable. This changed a few years ago. The good thing is that it
 * resolves some problems as some companies were given a simple ".uk"
 * TLD and these were exceptions the library does not need to support
 * anymore. There are still some countries, such as ".bd", which do not
 * accept second level names, so "example.bd" does return
 * an \em error (TLD_RESULT_INVALID).
 *
 * Assuming that you always get valid URIs, you should get one of those
 * results:
 *
 * \li TLD_RESULT_SUCCESS -- success! the URI is valid and the TLD was
 * properly determined; use the f_tld or f_offset to extract the TLD
 * domain and sub-domains
 * \li TLD_RESULT_INVALID -- known TLD, but not currently valid; this
 * result is returned when we know that the TLD is not to be accepted
 *
 * Other results are returned when the input string is considered invalid.
 *
 * \note
 * The function only accepts a bare URI, in other words: no protocol, no
 * path, no anchor, no query string, and still URI encoded. Also, it
 * should not start and/or end with a period or you are likely to get
 * an invalid response. (i.e. don't use any of ".example.co.uk.",
 * "example.co.uk.", nor ".example.co.uk")
 *
 * \include example.c
 *
 * \param[in] uri  The URI to be checked.
 * \param[out] info  A pointer to a tld_info structure to save the result.

/** \brief Check that a URI is valid.
 *
 * This function very quickly parses a URI to determine whether it
 * is valid.
 *
 * Note that it does not (currently) support local naming conventions
 * which means that a host such as "localhost" will fail the test.
 *
 * The \p protocols variable can be set to a list of protocol names
 * that are considered valid. For example, for HTTP protocol one
 * could use "http,https". To accept any protocol use an asterisk
 * as in: "*". The protocol must be only characters, digits, or
 * underscores ([0-9A-Za-z_]+) and it must be at least one character.
 *
 * The flags can be set to the following values, or them to set multiple
 * flags at the same time:
 *
 * \li VALID_URI_ASCII_ONLY -- refuse characters that are not in the
 * first 127 range (we expect the URI to be UTF-8 encoded and any
 * byte with bit 7 set is considered invalid if this flag is set,
 * including encoded bytes such as %A0)
 * \li VALID_URI_NO_SPACES -- refuse spaces whether they are encoded
 * with + or %20 or verbatim.
 *
 * The return value is generally TLD_RESULT_BAD_URI when an invalid
 * character is found in the URI string. The TLD_RESULT_NULL is
 * returned if the URI is a NULL pointer or an empty string.
 * Other results may be returned by the tld() function. If a result
 * other than TLD_RESULT_SUCCESS is returned then the info structure
 * may or may not be updated.
 *
 * \param[in] uri  The URI which validity is being checked.
 * \param[out] info  The resulting information about the URI domain and TLD.
 * \param[in] protocols  List of comma separated protocols accepted.
 * \param[in] flags  A set of flags to tell the function what is valid/invalid.
 *
 * \return The result of the operation, TLD_RESULT_SUCCESS if the URI is
 * valid.

 * \brief Special status to indicate an exception which is not directly a TLD.
 *
 * When a NIC decides to change their setup it can generate exceptions. For

 * to use .uk. Later they decided to only offer second level domain names
 * such as the .co.uk and .ac.uk. This generates a few exceptions on the .uk
 * domain name. For example, the police.uk domain is still in use and thus
 * it is an exception. We reference it as ".police.uk" in our XML data file
 * yet the TLD in that case is just ".uk".
