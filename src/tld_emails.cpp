/** \file
 * \brief Implementation of an email parser.
 *
 * This file includes all the functions available in the C library
 * of libtld. The format of emails is described in RFC 5322 paragraph
 * 3.4. That RFC uses the ABNF defined in RFC 5234. We limit our
 * implementation to reading a line of email addresses, not a full
 * email buffer. Thus we are limited to the content of a field such
 * as the "To:" field. We support emails that are written as:
 *
 * username@domain.tld
 * "First & Last Name" <username@domain.tld>
 *
 * And we support lists thereof (emails separated by commas.)
 *
 * Also, emails may include internationalized characters (Unicode). Since
 * our systems make use of UTF-8, the input format can be considered as
 * UTF-8 in which case we simply accept all characters from 0xA0 to
 * 0x10FFFF (the full Unicode range.) However, we also support the Q and B
 * encoding to directly support email fields. The B encoding is base64 of
 * UTF-8 data which works in ASCII 7 bit. The Q is ASCII with characters
 * marked with the equal sign and their 2 byte codes. This works well when
 * all the characters fit in one character set. Note that all characters
 * can be represented because more than one encoding can be used within
 * a phrase, but it is unlikely to be used that way.
 *
 * Text versions:
 *
 * http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5322.txt
 * http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5234.txt
 * http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1522.txt
 *
 * HTML versions (with links):
 *
 * http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322
 * http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234
 * http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1522
 *
 * \note
 * At this point we do not foresee offering group capabilities. Therefore
 * the code does not support such. It will certainly be added later.
 * Note that the parser will skip all white spaces, including comments.
 * This means once parsed, all those white spaces and comments are lost.
 *
 * \note
 * The following code comes from a mix versions starting with RFC 2822
 * (http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt) which still accepted all
 * control characters everywhere. Now only white spaces are allowed
 * in most places (\\r\\n\\t and the space \\x20). We also do not
 * allow control characters all over the place because it is likely
 * not valid.
 *
 * \code
 * (this part is not implemented, it just shows what is expected to be used for such
 * and such field.)

/** \brief Parse one email to a tld_email_t object.
 *
 * The \p email parameter is expected to represent exactly one email.
 * This function is expected to only be used by the tld_email_list
 * parser with valid data, although it is definitively not forbidden
 * to make use of this function, you may find it more difficult to
 * use directly.
 *
 * The canonicalized email address in the list of resulting emails
 * has the domain canonicalized using the tld_domain_to_lowercase()
 * function. This means it will be in lowercase and special characters
 * (including UTF-8 characters) will be transformed to %XX notation.
 *
 * \note
 * If the email is not valid, then the tld_email_t object remains
 * unchanged.
 *
 * \exception std::logic_error
 * If a quoted string or a comment have an unexpected character in
 * them then this exception is raised. If you are calling this
 * function directly then you may get this exception. If you called
 * the parse() function of the tld_email_list then this exception
 * should never happen because the previous level captures those
 * errors already (hence the exception.)
 *
 * \param[in] email  The email to be parsed.
 *
 * \return The result of the parsing, TLD_RESULT_SUCCESS on success,
 * another value otherwise.

/** \struct tld_email_list::tld_email_t

 *
 * When parsing a list of email addresses, one can include a display name,

 * the display name. Also the list may include comments and group
 * names.
 *
 * This structure is used internally to store the emails and when someone
 * queries the different emails with the \p next() or \p tld_email_next()
 * functions.
 *
 * Note that in the list of emails, a new group is announced by itself.
 * This means an entry may have just and only the f_group field defined.
 *
 * The fields of this structure use the same encoding as the input which
 * is expected to be UTF-8 unless otherwise defined in the emails
 * themselves. In the current version we do not decode international
 * characters, however, we do plan to do so in a future version. This
 * means the results should always be seen as valid UTF-8 even if for
 * now it is just ASCII.
 *
 * \note
 * I made this a simple structure instead of a class with all the fields
 * private because I think it makes it easier. If you use the C++ version
 * then you get a copy of the internal data in your own tld_email_t
 * structure. However, the C version returns a tld_email object which
 * has pointers pointing directly to the internal data. In that case it
 * is a security risk as the strings should never be modified from the
 * outside. Also a call to the \p parse() function replaces the list of
 * email in effect invalidating all the pointers of all the tld_email
 * objects that still exist.

 * only this field is defined (all others are empty strings.) It is

 * the possible trimming that was done before and after the email (the
 * parser removes the leading and ending white spaces, new lines, and

 * For example, in the following email address:
 *
 * \code "Wilke, Alexis" <alexis@m2osw.com> \endcode
 *
 * The full name is "Wilke, Alexis".
 *
 * It is common to find empty full names. Your interpretation as a
 * human of the full name is likely to be correct. However, the
 * assumption for a common format is most certainly incorrect. For
 * example, in "Wilke, Alexis", assuming that "Alexis" is a first
 * name is just and only an assumption. In a display name such as
 * "Albert George, Jr." the "Jr." is not the first name. There is
 * no definition on how the display name should be presented.

 * it is the user as listed in /etc/passwd.
 *

 * known when we parse an email. It is expected that the destination
 * generates an error if the character set is not supported. On our
 * end, the final result is always UTF-8.

/** \var tld_email_list::tld_email_t::f_domain
 * \brief The domain part of the email address.

 * The parameter is always defined (except in a group definition)
 * and represents the server handling the mail box for the email
 * address. The domain is always checked for validity with the
 * \p tld() function. So if the user typed an address such as:
 *
 * \code
 * alexis@m2osw
 * \endcode
 *
 * The email parser returns an error because the domain name m2osw
 * is not valid. It should be m2osw.com or some other similar
 * extension.
 *
 * All the emails are checked in this way so only valid domains
 * are accepted. Note that also prevents someone from using an
 * IP address as the destination server. So email addresses such
 * as:
 *
 * \code
 * alexis@1.2.3.4
 * \endcode
 *
 * Are not considered valid and should never be used anyway.

 * of the atom set of characters, then it will be written between

 * a comma, etc.)
 *
 * Similarly, the domain name could include characters that
 * cannot be represented with an atom, although that's unlikely
