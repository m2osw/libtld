libtld for Debian
-----------------

Note that this package is really only temporarily up to date. The .ini
files will always be a little bit behind.

It needs to be updated each time a new gTLD is accepted by INA and other
organizations.

In most cases, we try to keep the library up to date. However, since 2021
changes to the gTLDs are happening fast.
