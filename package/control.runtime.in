Description: TLD library to discover and verify TLDs in a URI.
 This package gives you the libtld library and the validate_tld tool.
 .
 The libtld offers capabilities to read any world wide TLD from any URI.
 The library understands all the currently valid TLDs and also knows of
 now unused TLDs, and the few TLDs that are assigned but still not used.
 It also can be used to check email addresses and full URIs. It comes
 with a tool, validate_tld, which can be directly used on your command
 line to validate URIs and emails. Finally, it includes a PHP extension
 to access the library directly from your PHP scripts.
